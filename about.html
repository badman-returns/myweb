                                        It was around 2010-11 when my brother introduces me to HTML, at that time I was
                                        only 10. From the beginning I was not very good at academics neither interested
                                        as there was nothing except mugging up and as I was a kind of introvert I look
                                        around myself to do some creative stuff(ex. Drawing, Art & Craft). It was this
                                        time when I got very much interested to computers. I started learning HTML from
                                        my brother and made some web pages and believe me nobody at school was teaching
                                        about Computers at that time. So I kind of gain confidence as this was only
                                        thing I know I was better than any kids of my age.

                                        Next year a computer was bought into home and I started learning moe about
                                        technology. At this time I got to know about hacking and security stuff which
                                        thrives me more towards tech. I started learning linux, networking althought it
                                        was very challeging for me as no one was there to help or support, only thing I
                                        do that time was Google.


                                        When I was 14 , it was around 12:20 at night I secretly hacked into someone's
                                        computer within my Local Network as in our place ISP used to NAT an IP Address
                                        and distribute them among various customers. Believe me I will never forget that
                                        moment
                                        in my life. From that time onwards I knew that this is the thing I am gonna do
                                        for rest of my life.
                                        After then something happened, until I finished my high school I was not being
                                        able to do all these kinds of stuff. As I was becoming more poor in academics my
                                        family does not allow me to do all those stuffs until I finished my school. It
                                        was very difficult for me but I have no options also. Anyway time passed I
                                        reached college but still somehow I was able to keep updates about current
                                        technology.

                                        Finally I got the freedom to do what I love to do. So thats all brief about
                                        myself. To know more please visit the blog section. I write both my personal and
                                        technical blog there. Feel free to message, visit contact section.
